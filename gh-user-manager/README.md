# 🧑‍💻 Gh User Manager — VS Code Extension

*The fastest way to switch identities since Clark Kent found a phone booth.*

## 🔥 What is this?

A VS Code extension that lets you **add**, **switch**, **list**, and **delete** multiple GitHub user profiles from your local Git config.
Whether you're working on open-source, freelancing, or juggling corporate and side hustle repos — this extension makes sure you always commit as the right you™️.

> No more accidental "oops wrong email" commits.
> No more keychain jungle.
> Just pure identity zen.

## 💻 Why Use This?

Because:

* You commit to more than one GitHub account.
* You’re tired of running `git config` commands manually.
* You keep mixing personal and work commits (your manager noticed).
* You want a clean, simple way to manage multiple identities without leaving VS Code.
